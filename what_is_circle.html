                        <h3>Project Circle is a game inspired by Jackbox, Amongs Us and various 
                        other titles. One very important thing they have in common is the fact
                        that they are free/low price minigames for you and your friends to play in.
                        During these hard times, in which most of us find ourselves unnable to
                        connect often with friends in person, we created this concept to
                        continue adding more outlets for people to use when they most need to
                        reconnect with friends. </h3>
                        <h3>The creative and narrative aspects of the game are precisely what make
                        it different from its counterparts. It unifies the experience of playing
                        different minigames with a larger strategic game that encourages building
                        relationships with other players.
                        Finally, those relationships are tested by forcing players to rank their alliances,
                        voting each other out until one player is victorious.</h3>
